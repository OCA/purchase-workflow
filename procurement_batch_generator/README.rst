Procurement Batch Generator
===========================

This module adds a wizard on the product variants tree view to request
procurements. The official *stock* module adds a button *Request
Procurement* in the *Inventory* tab of the product form view (next to
the *Incoming quantity*) ; this module does the same thing in batch
for several products at the same time.
