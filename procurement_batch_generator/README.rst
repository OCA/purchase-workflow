===========================
Procurement Batch Generator
===========================

This module adds a wizard on the product variants tree view to request
procurements. The official *stock* module adds a button

same thing in batch for several products at the same time.

Usage
=====

Go to the list of product variants, select several products and click on
*Action > Procurement Requests*.
