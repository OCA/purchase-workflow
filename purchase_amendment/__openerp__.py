Purchase Amendment
==================
This module is meant to assist the users in handling the cases when the company
changes his mind about a purchase.

See also `sale_amendment` (in https://github.com/OCA/sale-workflow)
which covers a similar use case for changes in sale orders.


Usage
=====
Once a purchase order is confirmed, an 'Amend' button is shown on the
view's header. Clicking on this button will open a new window with the
order's lines and the quantity to amend.

Amending a purchase order will cancel the stock moves and create new
ones with the new quantities.

An invoiced purchase order cannot be amended.
