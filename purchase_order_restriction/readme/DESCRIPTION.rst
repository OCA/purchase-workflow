This module adds Restrict Access boolean field in the purchase order model, to limit the
access to the purchase order to 1) the buyer and 2) purchase managers.

The module can be useful if there are orders whose conditions should not be visible to
wide range of buyers (e.g. contract rates of the temp staff).
