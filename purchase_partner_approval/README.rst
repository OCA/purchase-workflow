Require partners to be approved before thay can be used on Purchase Orders.

This does not require, but was designed to be used with
Partner Tier Validation (partner_tier_validation module).

Using that module, rules can be configured on who must approve,
before the Partner Stage can be changed to an apptoved one.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Configuration
=============

The Purchase Order validation rules are configurable.
By default Purchase Order confirmation is prevented is the Vendor or Drop Ship Address
is not approvaed to be used in Purchase.

To configure Purchase Order validations navigate to
Purchase / Configuration / Purchase Exception Rules.
You need to belong to the Exception Manager security group to see this menu option.

For new vendor to require approval before being sold to, configure the Contact Stages
appropriately. For example:

* Navigate to Contacts / Configuration / Contact Stages
* Edit the "Active" stage: uncheck "Default Stage" and check "Approved for Purchase"
* Edit the "Draft" stage: check "Default Stage" and uncheck "Approved for Purchase"

Usage
=====

To approve a Partner to be used in purchase:

* Edit the Partner form, and in the "Sales & Purchase" tab check the "Candidate to Purchase" box.
* Make sure the Parter is in a Stage that has the "Approved for Purchase" checkbox enabled.
  If this is the case, the Partner will automatically have enabled the "Can Purchase To" checkbox.
  found next to the "Candidate to Purchase" checkbox.

The "Candidate to Purchase" checkbox is only available in a draft/to approve Stage.
The "Can Purchase To" will only be set when moving to a Stage that is not draft/to approve.
Moving from an approved Stage to a draft one will not automatically reset the "Can Purchase To".
This means that removing from Can Purchase state also needs to go through an approval.

On a Purchase Order:

* The "Vendor" and "Drop Ship Address" selection lists
  only propose partners you "Can Purchase To".
* The CONFIRM button will show a blocking exception message if the selected Customeror
  Drop Ship Address do not have the "Can Purchase To" flag checked (this may vary depending
  how the exception rules are configured).
