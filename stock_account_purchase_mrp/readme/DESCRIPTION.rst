This module computes the cost of the components of a kit - BOM according to different policies.
The cost of each component is computed as follows:

* None: Standard behaviour.
* By line: We take the cost of the parent product, and divide proportionally by each component.
* By quantities: We take the cost of the parent product, and divide by each component.
