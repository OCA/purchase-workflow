This module adds to the Purchase Workflow the ability to skip the
backorder creation when validating a PO's Receipt, depending on the
configured **Receipt Threshold**.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Go to **Settings > General Settings > Purchase** and set the
   **Receipt Threshold** value.
2. Go to a Partner and set the **Use Threshold** value.

These settings will be applied to the Purchase Order and its lines.

Usage
=====

When validating a PO's **Receipt**, if any stock move's **Quantity**
falls within the threshold specified on the Purchase Order and its
lines, the wizard to create a backorder is skipped, as well as the
actual backorder creation, even when the picking type's **Create
Backorder** is set to **Always** or **Ask**.
