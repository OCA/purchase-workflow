This module adds an approval state for suppliers. There are 3 available states:

  * Pending to approval (by default)
  * Approved
  * Not approved

Suppliers can be approved only by a specific group of users: **Suppliers approval**.

The supplier approval state is used in purchase order confirmation process.
Only orders with approved suppliers can be confirmed.
