This module add ability to create Work Acceptance based on the predefined invoice plan, one by one.

**Note:**

Because WA is now based on invoice plan, the option "Create Bill by Plan" will be removed.

User will be left with only option "Create Bill" (and to choose WA), the chosen WA is now used to control the quantity in invoice instead of the invoice plan.
