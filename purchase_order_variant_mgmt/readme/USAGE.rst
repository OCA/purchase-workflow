* Go to Purchases > Purchase > Requests for Quotation
* Create a new quotation or edit an existing one.
* Press "Add variants" button located in the upper right corner of the
   "Order Lines" tab.
* A new screen will appear allowing you to select the products that have
   variants.
* Once you select the product, a 2D matrix will appear with the first
   attribute values as columns and the second one as rows.
* If there are already order lines for the product variants, the current
   quantity will be pre-filled in the matrix.
* Change the quantities for the variant you want and click on "Transfer to
   order"
* Order lines for the variants will be created/removed to comply with the
   input you have done.

As extra feature for saving steps, there's also a button on each existing line
that corresponds to a variant that opens the dialog directly with the product
selected.
