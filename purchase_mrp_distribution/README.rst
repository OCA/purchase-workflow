This module allows you to buy a product that will be divided into others without 
knowing the exact quantity of the others. That quantity will be filled in the picking.

Configuration
=============

To use this module, we will need to configure n different distribution-type Bills of 
Materials (BoM) for n products. To do this, we will follow these steps:

#. Go to Manufacturing > Products > Bills of Materials
#. Click on Create
#. Select the product to be distributed in the receptions
#. Select the BoM type "Distribution"
#. In the components, add the products that can be filled in the reception (it is not 
   necessary to mark the quantity as it will default to 0)

Usage
=====

To see the module's functionality:

1. Create a new purchase order
2. Add the product for which the BoM has been created
3. Confirm the order
4. Go to the created delivery order
5. You will see a new button in the move that contains the product, click on it
6. A wizard will open to define the quantity of each product to distribute
7. By clicking on Distribute, the move lines will be added with the products from the 
   BoM

Changelog
=========

This module aims to address the need to receive a generic product, but until the 
moment of reception, we do not know the quantity that we might receive of its 
specific products.

Using kits was not suitable for us, because to account for a unit of the kit product, 
the quantity specified in the BoM must be received. Therefore, we opted to define a 
new type of BoM called distribution.

In this way, upon receiving a unit of any product added to the BoM, it will be 
accounted for as a unit of the generic product and will be reflected in the svls as 
separate products, but they will be accounted for in the purchase line as part of the 
product.
