This module aims to address the need to receive a generic product, but until the 
moment of reception, we do not know the quantity that we might receive of its 
specific products.

Using kits was not suitable for us, because to account for a unit of the kit product, 
the quantity specified in the BoM must be received. Therefore, we opted to define a 
new type of BoM called distribution.

In this way, upon receiving a unit of any product added to the BoM, it will be 
accounted for as a unit of the generic product and will be reflected in the svls as 
separate products, but they will be accounted for in the purchase line as part of the 
product.
