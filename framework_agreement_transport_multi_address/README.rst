Use framework agreements with transport addresses
=================================================

This module improves the compatibility between the modules for framework
agreements and transport addresses. It is installed automatically if both
modules are installed on your database.

With this module, you can specify a specific origin address on a framework's
pricelist, which is then propagated to the purchases on that framework.
agreement. Any existing framework pricelists are assigned the supplier as its
default origin address.
