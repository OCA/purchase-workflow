The standard field invoice_status show information about the status
of the invoices related to a Purchase Order.

However, it can be than the field invoice status can be "invoiced" when the invoices
are still in draft. Many times that makes the difference to consider the Purchase Order
as closed or not. Because of this, this module introduce a new field, Fully Invoiced,
taking the state into account.
