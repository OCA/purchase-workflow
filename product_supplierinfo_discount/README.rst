This module allows to input a discount in the supplier info form, and propagate
it to purchase order lines:

* The discount appears explicitly in purchase orders instead of being directly
  discounted in price.
* You can set prices and discounts on the same screen.

* A new field default_supplierinfo_discount is added on res.partner model.
  This value will be used as the default one, on each supplierinfo of that
  supplier.

Note: this setting is a new 'company' setting, unavailable for related
partners, as accounting-related Settings.

Installation
============

This module requires **purchase_discount** module.


Usage
=====

Go to **Purchase > Products**, open one product, and edit or add a record on
the **Vendors** section of the **Purchase** tab. You will see in the prices
section in the down part a new column called **Discount (%)**. You can enter
here the desired discount for that quantity.

When you make a purchase order for that supplier and that product, discount
will be put automatically.
