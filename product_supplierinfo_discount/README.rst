==================================
Discounts in product supplier info
==================================

This module allows to input a discount in the supplier info form, and propagate
it to purchase order lines:

* The discount appears explicitly in purchase orders instead of being directly
  discounted in price.
* You can set prices and discounts on the same screen.

* A new field default_supplierinfo_discount is added on res.partner model.
  This value will be used as the default one, on each supplierinfo of that
  supplier.

Note: this setting is a new 'company' setting, unavailable for related partners,
as accounting-related Settings.

Installation
============

This module requires *purchase_discount* module, that it's also available in
this repository.

Configuration
=============

To see prices and discounts on supplier info view, you have to enable the
option "Manage pricelist per supplier" inside *Configuration > Purchases*

Usage
=====

Go to Purchase > Products, open one product, and edit or add a record on the
*Suppliers* section of the *Procurements*. You will see in the prices section
in the down part a new column called *Discount (%)*. You can enter here
the desired discount for that quantity.

When you make a purchase order for that supplier and that product, discount
will be put automatically.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* The discount is always applied, independently if you have based
  your pricelist on other value than "Supplier Prices on the product form".
