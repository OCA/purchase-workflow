===========================
Purchase Commercial Partner
===========================

This module adds a related stored field *Commercial Supplier* on purchase orders. It is similar to the native field *Commercial Partner* on invoices. This module is the twin brother of the OCA module *sale_commercial_partner* located in the `sale-workflow project <https://github.com/OCA/sale-workflow/>`_.

Usage
=====

In the search view of RFQ/purchase orders, you can group by *Commercial Supplier*.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

Add commercial_partner_id in purchase.report. This is not easy because the
SQL view which is the basis of purchase.report cannot be inherited.

Bug Tracker
===========

Bugs are tracked on `GitHub Issues
<https://github.com/OCA/purchase-workflow/issues>`_. In case of trouble, please
check there if your issue has already been reported. If you spotted it first,
help us smashing it by providing a detailed and welcomed feedback.
