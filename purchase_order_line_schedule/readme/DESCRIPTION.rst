This module allows users to introduce a delivery schedule associated to
a purchase order line. A schedule is used when a quantity on an order line
is requested to be delivered in multiple dates.

The Delivery schedule allows you to specify the number of dates in
which the total quantity of the order line will be delivered from the vendor.

By default, the system copies the total quantity and scheduled date
of the original purchase line into the first delivery schedule line.
