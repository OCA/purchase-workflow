This module adds a Calendar to the ResPartner model. This calendar can then
used as the basis of the proper computation of start/end dates based on the
delivery lead time of the supplier in this and other modules.

In this module, the calendar is considered in the computation of the schedules
date of a stock picking and in the order date of a purchase order.
