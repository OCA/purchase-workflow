This module adds a Calendar to the ResPartner model. This calendar can then
used as the basis of the proper computation of start/end dates based on the
delivery lead time of the supplier in this and other modules.

In this module, the calendar is considered in the computation of the schedules
date of a stock picking and in the order date of a purchase order.

Configuration
=============

* Go to *Settings* and activate the developer mode.

* Go to *Settings > Technical > Resource > Working Time* and define your
  resource calendar.

* Go to *Contacts > Sales&Purchases > Purchase > Delay Calendar Type*
  and assign Supplier Calendar and in *Factory Closing Days* assign the
  Resource Calendar desired.


Usage
=====

When a picking is created from a purchase order of a supplier, the lead
time used to calculate the scheduled date is computed in natural days. At the
same time, when a purchase order is created due to a a procurement
evaluation, its order date is also computed considering the lead time in
natural days. THis module adds the possibility of expressing the lead time
of a vendor in his own calendar. This way, the order dates of purchase
orders and the scheduled dates of receipts will only take into account the
supplier working days.
