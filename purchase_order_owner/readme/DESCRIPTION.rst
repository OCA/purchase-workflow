This module adds Assign Owner (owner_id) field in purchase order, whose value will be
passed to the corresponding field of the incoming picking upon order confirmation.

This module can be useful in a business situation where you purchase products in place of
a client (you seprately issue an invoice to the client and the inventory is owned by them,
although you physically keep the inventory in your premise).
