When purchasing, users can indicate a usage from a list, for every item in the
purchase order.

Usages can be associated with specific accounts. When the supplier invoice is
created from that purchase order line, the account defined for that usage
will be proposed, instead of the product's default expense account. This
proposal will only be effective if the product is a consumable or a service.


Usages can be very diverse, like internal use, marketing use, testing use.
So a product "Paper" could potentially translate to marketing expense,
or an office expense, irrespective of what is the expense account defined in
the product "Paper".

Configuration
=============

In order to be able to define usages, assign users to the group
"Define Purchase Product Usages". The group is proposed by default to users
in the group "Purchase Manager"


Go to *Purchase / Configuration / Purchase Product Usages* and define
the usages, indicating the description and optionally the code, default
product and account to use.

Usage
=====

In the PO line set the usage of the purchased product.
If the usage has a default product it will be set in the PO line.
If the product is a consumable or a service then the invoice will take the
account from the usage. In any other case the normal behavior is expected.
