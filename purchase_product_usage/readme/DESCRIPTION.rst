When purchasing, users can indicate a usage from a list, for every item in the
purchase order.

Usages can be associated with specific accounts. When the supplier invoice is
created from that purchase order line, the account defined for that usage
will be proposed, instead of the product's default expense account. This
proposal will only be effective if the product is a consumable or a service.


Usages can be very diverse, like internal use, marketing use, testing use.
So a product "Paper" could potentially translate to marketing expense,
or an office expense, irrespective of what is the expense account defined in
the product "Paper".
