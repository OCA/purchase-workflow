Compute on a purchase order the amount of transport packing (e.g. pallets). The computation is on each line and a total is computed on the order. 
Each product needs a packaging definition for this transport packaging to allow the computation. The transport packaging is a packaging level you 
must first configure in the settings (typically the Tertiary packaging level, i.e. pallet).
