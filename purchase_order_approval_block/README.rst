This module allows you to block the approval of an RFQ when an Approval
Block Reason has been provided. Upon confirmation of an RFQ the orders will be
waiting for approval by a Manager.

Configuration
=============

* Go to ‘Purchases / Configuration / Purchase Approval Block Reasons’ and create
  the blocking reasons as needed, providing a name and a description. A field
  ‘Active’ allows you to deactivate the reason if you do not plan to use it
  any more.
* Assign the security group 'Release RFQ with approval block' to users that
  should be able to release the block. Users in group 'Purchase / Managers'
  are by default assigned to this group.

Usage
=====

Set the Purchase Approval Block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Go to ‘Purchases / Purchase / Requests for Quotation’
#. Create a new RFQ and indicate the approval block reason (found in the
   right hand side of the screen, below the order date).

Search existing RFQ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a filter ‘Blocked’ to search for orders that are blocked for approval.
It is also possible to search RFQ’s with a specific block reason.

Confirm the RFQ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Press the button ‘Confirm’. If there’s an approval block, the order will
   be set to status 'To Approve'. You will then need to request a Purchase
   Manager to approve it.

Release the purchase approval block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the RFQ is in draft, members of security group ‘Release RFQ with approval block’,
can see a button ‘Release Approval Block’. From this point and on, anyone
seeing that RFQ will be able to validate it.

Notifications to followers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Followers of the RFQ receive notifications when an approval block has been
set or released.
