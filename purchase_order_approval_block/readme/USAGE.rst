Set the Purchase Approval Block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Go to ‘Purchases / Purchase / Requests for Quotation’
#. Create a new RFQ and indicate the approval block reason (found in the
   right hand side of the screen, below the order date).

Search existing RFQ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a filter ‘Blocked’ to search for orders that are blocked for approval.
It is also possible to search RFQ’s with a specific block reason.

Confirm the RFQ
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Press the button ‘Confirm’. If there’s an approval block, the order will
   be set to status 'To Approve'. You will then need to request a Purchase
   Manager to approve it.

Release the purchase approval block
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

While the RFQ is in draft, members of security group ‘Release RFQ with approval block’,
can see a button ‘Release Approval Block’. From this point and on, anyone
seeing that RFQ will be able to validate it.

Notifications to followers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Followers of the RFQ receive notifications when an approval block has been
set or released.
