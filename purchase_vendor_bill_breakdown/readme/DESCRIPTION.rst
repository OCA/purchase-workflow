This module offers a solution for the following scenario:

* We purchase a **Toolbox** product from a supplier
* Supplier delivers us the Toolbox but issues an invoice with **1x Box**, **2x Wrench**, **5x Screwdriver** and **1x Hammer** products in line

This module allows to replace a product in PO Line with a predefined set of components in the vendor bill line and also allows to calculate vendors product price by product components price.

Please note: this module is not compatible with stock. To use these features with stock components, you need to install module purchase_stock_vendor_bill_breakdown .
