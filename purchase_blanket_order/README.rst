A purchase blanket order is a pre-agreement to purchase a certain number of
quantities of products at a specific price. From a confirmed blanket order,
the users can create new purchase orders at such price, until the blanket
order expires due to reaching the validity date.

Usage
=====

A new menu in the Purchase area is created, allowing users to create new blanket orders.

To create a new Purchase Blanket Order go to the purchase menu in the Purchase section:

Hitting the button create will open the form view in which we can introduce the following
information:

* Vendor
* Payment Terms
* Ordering and Validity dates
* Order lines:
    * Product
    * Accorded price
    * Original, Ordered, Invoiced, Received and Remaining quantities
* Terms and Conditions of the Blanket Order

From the form, once the Blanket Order has been confirmed and its state is open, the user can
create a Purchase Order, check the Purchase Orders associated to the Blanket Order and/or
see the Blanket Order lines associated to the BO.

Hitting the button Create Purchase Order will open a wizard that will ask for the amount of each
product in the BO lines for which the Purchase Order will be created.

Installing this module will add an additional menu which will show all the blanket order lines
currently defined in the system. From this list the user can create customized Purchase Orders
selecting the lines for which the PO (or POs if the vendors are different) is (are) created.

In the Purchase Order form one field is added in the PO lines, the Blanket Order line field. This
field keeps track to which Blanket Order line the PO line is associated. Upon adding a new product
in a newly created Purchase Order a blanket order line will be suggested depending on the following
factors:

* Closer Validity date
* Remaining quantity > Quantity introduced in the Purchase Order line
