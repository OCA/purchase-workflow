This module provides different configuration option to manage packagings on
purchase orders.

The creation/update of purchase order line will be blocked (by constraints) if the data on the
purchase.order.line does not fit with the configuration of the product's packagings.

It's also possible to force the quantity to purchase during creation/modification of the purchase order line
if the "Force purchase quantity" is ticked on the packaging.

For example, if your packaging is set to purchase by 5 units and the employee fill
the quantity with 3, the quantity will be automatically replaced by 5 (it always rounds up).

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.

Configuration
=============

Following options are available to define which packaging type can be purchased and
which product can only be purchased by packaging.

* Can be purchased: On product packaging type model, this checkbox defines if product
  packagings from this particular type are available to be selected on purchase
  order line.

* purchase only by packaging: On product template model, this checkbox restricts
  purchases of these products if no packaging is selected on the purchase order line.
  If no packaging is selected, it will either be auto-assigned if the quantity
  on the purchase order line matches a packaging quantity or an error will be raised.

* Force purchase quantity (on the packaging): force rounds up the quantity during
  creation/modification of the purchase order line with the factor set on the packaging.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Odoo allows to define product.packaging records with a qty = 0. This does not
  make much sense with the can_be_purchased checkbox, and we probably need to add a
  constraint here.
