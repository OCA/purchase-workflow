This module adds a restriction in purchase and supplier invoices that has the
mark "Order and invoice only supplied products" checked for allowing to select
only products that can be supplied by the defined vendor.

The restriction can be set by default for each partner, and it's propagated
to their supplier invoices and purchases, but it can be changed for each
invoice and purchase order if you want.
