Installation
============

This module depends on ``base_tier_validation``. You can find it at
`OCA/server-ux <https://github.com/OCA/server-ux>`__

Configuration
=============

A default tier is created allowing Purchase Request Manager to approve
Purchase Requests.

In addition, you may want to add more tiers, so:

1. Go to *Settings > Technical > Tier Validations > Tier Definition*.
2. Create as many tiers as you want for Purchase Order model.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Create a Purchase Request triggering at least one "Tier Definition".
2. Click on *Request Validation* button.
3. Under the tab *Reviews* have a look to pending reviews and their
   statuses.
4. Once all reviews are validated button to *Confirm* will be shown.

Additional features:

-  You can filter the Purchase Request requesting your review through
   the filter *Needs my Review*.
-  User with rights to confirm the Purchase Request (validate all tiers
   that would be generated) can directly do the operation, this is,
   there is no need for her/him to request a validation.
