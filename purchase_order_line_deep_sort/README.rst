This module was written to extend the functionality of purchase order and allow
you to manage sort of lines.

You can set the default sort order for the current company or you can set sort
order for a particular purchase order.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Configuration
=============

* Sort criteria items can be defined with a dot notation. This means that you
  can define an order as follows: **product_id.default_code**. But the field
  defined must exist in database. If you define, e.g., a calculated field, sort
  criteria won't work.

Usage
=====

#. Go to **Purchase > Settings > Default Sort Criteria** and select one.
#. You must select sort direction too.
#. Create a new purchase and add several lines.
#. On saving purchase order you must see how the purchase lines are ordered
   with your selected sort order.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Add support for ordering purchase lines by partner.
