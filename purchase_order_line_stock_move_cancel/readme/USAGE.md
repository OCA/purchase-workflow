Once the purchase order is confirmed and the receipt stock moves have been generated,
a cancel icon will be visible on each purchase order line.

When clicking, a wizard will be displayed in order to validate the cancellation. Once
the stock move has been cancelled, the icon will disappear (the state on purchase order
line won't be changed as it depends directly on purchase order one).

On purchase order level, the cancellation will be logged in the chatter.
