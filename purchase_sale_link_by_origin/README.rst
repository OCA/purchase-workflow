By default since `Odoo
14.0 <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/commit/5a1645a8f8f3560eb778da90b6160b322ce0722e>`__,
PO and SO are linked by their order lines.

This module also link them by the PO's Origin field, to cover more
cases. For example:

-  If a user cancels a PO, by default the link would have been broken;
   now it won't;
-  Or if a user manually defines or updates the Origin field of a PO, it
   will be taken into account.
