Go to "Purchase -> Configuration -> Settings" and scroll down to the "Orders" section.
Enable the "Partial Confirmation" checkbox.
Enable the "Save Unconfirmed Items" checkbox if you want to create a quotation with all the unconfirmed items.
Define a suffix for the unconfirmed items quotation in the "Unconfirmed Quotation Suffix" field. If no suffix is defined then a standard "-U" suffix will be used. Eg "PO00023-U".
