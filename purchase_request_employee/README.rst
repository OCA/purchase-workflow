The Purchase Request Employee module is an addon that enhances the Purchase Request functionality by adding a field that
allows the selection of the employee who requested the purchase. This is useful in situations where not all employees are
registered as users in the system, or when a supervisor creates a request on behalf of someone else.

Features
--------

- Adds a new field in the Purchase Request form to select the employee who requested the purchase.
- Allows you to identify the employee who requested the purchase, even if they are not registered as users in the system.
- The selected employee is passed on to the related Purchase Orders, making it easier to track who requested the purchase.
- Helps to maintain a more accurate record of purchase requests and their respective authors.
