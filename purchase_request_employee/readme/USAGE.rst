Once installed, the module adds a new field to the Purchase Request form where you can select the employee who requested the purchase.
You can select the appropriate employee, and the system will save it along with the purchase request.
The selected employee will also be passed on to the related Purchase Orders, making it easier to track who requested the purchase.
