#. Go to **Purchase > Orders > Purchase Orders**
#. Create a Purchase Order and assing a **Purchase Representative**
   (in the **Other Information** tab), if you are a Purchase User or Manager.
   If you are a Purchass User (own orders), i'll be automatically assigned,
   and you won't be able to change it
#. Enable the `is_restricted` option in the purchase order if you want
   to prevent other users from viewing your PO.
#. Confirm the Purchase Order
#. Go back to the **Purchase Orders** view.
#. If you are a Purchase User or a Purchase Manager, you can see all orders. If you are a Purchase User (own orders),
   you'll only see your own orders. If you are a Purchase User (own or unrestricted orders), you'll see
   both your own orders and those that are unrestricted.
