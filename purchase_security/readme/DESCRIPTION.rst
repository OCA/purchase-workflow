This add-on creates two new groups: "User (own orders)" and "User (own or unrestricted orders)"
in Purchases.

Users in the "User (own orders)" group can only see Purchase Orders where they are
the representative, or all of them if they are managers.

Users in the "User (own or unrestricted orders)" group can only see Purchase Orders where
they are the representative, as well as those where is_restricted is false. If they are managers,
they can see all orders.
