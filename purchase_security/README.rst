This addon creates new groups in Purchase.

Visibility of purchase orders is restricted for users in these groups.
You can only see the purchase order:

-  User (own orders): If you are a follower of the partner or there is
   no user or you are the partner's user.
-  User (team orders): If you are a follower of the partner or there is
   no user or you are a user of your purchasing team.
