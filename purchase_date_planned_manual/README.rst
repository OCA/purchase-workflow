This module makes the system to always respect the planned (or scheduled)
date set by the user when creating a Purchase Order.

Additionally, this module modifies the PO views and sets in red the lines
that are predicted to arrive late compared to the scheduled date and vendor
lead time.

Usage
=====

To use this module you could follow any of the two options below:

#. Go to 'Purchase' and create a purchase order.
#. Manually set the scheduled date in the PO lines.
#. This date will never be modified by the system and the lines that are
   expected to be late are highlighted in red.

Or:

#. Create a procurement order for a product that can be bought and have the
   route 'buy' activated.
#. Run the procurement.
#. Now the scheduled date in the procurement is respected even if the line is
   added to a previously existing PO.
