When this module is installed, each Purchase Order you confirm will
generate one Incoming Shipment for each schedule date indicated in the
Purchase Order Lines.

Once the Purchase Order has been confirmed, subsequent changes made to the
scheduled dates in the PO lines will produce a reorganization of the
corresponding stock moves in the Incoming Shipments, creating/deleting new
Incoming Shipments when needed, to ensure that each Incoming Shipment
contains moves to be received in the same date.

This module is also designed for extensibility, so that you can define
in other modules new criteria to split deliveries.
