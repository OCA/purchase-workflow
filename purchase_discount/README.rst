This module allows to define a discount per line in the purchase orders. This
discount can be also negative, interpreting it as an increment.

It also modifies the purchase order report to include the discount field in it.

This module allows to input a discount in the supplier info form, and propagate
it to purchase order lines:

* The discount appears explicitly in purchase orders instead of being directly
  discounted in price.
* You can set prices and discounts on the same screen.

* A new field default_supplierinfo_discount is added on res.partner model.
  This value will be used as the default one, on each supplierinfo of that
  supplier.

Note: this setting is a new 'company' setting, unavailable for related
partners, as accounting-related Settings.

Usage
=====

Go to **Purchase > Products**, open one product, and edit or add a record on
the **Vendors** section of the **Purchase** tab. You will see in the prices
section in the down part a new column called **Discount (%)**. You can enter
here the desired discount for that quantity.

When you make a purchase order for that supplier and that product, discount
will be put automatically.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

With this module, the *price_unit* field of purchase order line stores the gross price instead of the net price, which is a change in the meaning of
this field. So this module breaks all the other modules that use the *price_unit* field with it's native meaning.
