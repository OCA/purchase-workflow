Discount in purchase orders
===========================

This module allows to define a discount per line in the purchase orders. This
discount can be also negative, interpreting it as an increment.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* This module can be incompatible with other modules that modify purchase
  prices, because it overwrites computation methods.
