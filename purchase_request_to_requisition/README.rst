Purchase Request to Call for Bids
=================================
This module introduces the following features:

* The possibility to create new Call for Bids or update existing Bids from
  Purchase Request Lines.


Usage
=====

* Go to the Purchase Request Lines from the menu entry 'Purchase Requests',
  and also from the 'Purchase' menu.

* Select the lines that you wish to initiate the RFQ for, then go to 'More'
  and press 'Create Purchase Bid'. You can choose to select an existing
  Draft Bid or create a new one.

* In case that you chose to select an existing Bid, the application will search
  for existing lines matching the request line, and will add the extra
  quantity to them.

* In case that you create a new RFQ, the request lines will also be
  consolidated into as few as possible lines in the RFQ.
