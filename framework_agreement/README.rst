Long Term Agreement (or Framework Agreement) for purchases
==========================================================

With an agreement, a price is agreed between you and a supplier for a product,
under certain conditions.

An agreement portfolio groups together many agreements belonging to the same
supplier.

In a purchase order, the user can choose a portfolio. For every line, if there
is exactly one available agreement, it will be chosen automatically. Otherwise,
the choice is left to the user.

Configuration
=============

In the company, a global setting lets the user choose whether to impose a limit
of one agreement per product.
