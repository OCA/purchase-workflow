This module adds one button on purchase orders (below the lines) that:

* Recalculates the prices of the order lines that contain a product in them.

It is launched manually as a button to get the user to decide if he/she wants to
recalculate prices when vendor is changed or after duplicating a purchase order
to update or not purchase information.
