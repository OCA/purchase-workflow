Purchase Request to RFQ
=======================
This module adds the possibility to create or update Requests for
Quotation (RFQ) from Purchase Request Lines.

Installation
============

No specific instructions required.


Configuration
=============

No specific instructions requied.

Usage
=====
Go to the Purchase Request Lines from the menu entry 'Purchase Requests',
and also from the 'Purchase' menu.

Select the lines that you wish to initiate the RFQ for, then go to 'More'
and press 'Create RFQ'.

You can choose to select an existing RFQ or create a new one. In the later,
you have to choose a supplier.

In case that you chose to select an existing RFQ, the application will search
for existing lines matching the request line, and will add the extra
quantity to them, recalculating the minimum order quantity,
if it exists for the supplier of that RFQ.

In case that you create a new RFQ, the request lines will also be
consolidated into as few as possible lines in the RFQ.
